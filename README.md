## Description
Our project is about evaluation of different channel allocation schemes in wireless networks.

We are mainly studying three different channel allocation schemes :

1. Distributed Scheme
2. Centralized Scheme
3. Hybrid Scheme

We will be designing each of the schemes, and study the performance of the system with each scheme and provide with an optimized solution.

_Description about files:_

_CClient_test_ : is for testing the connection between client and server for the centralized scheme

_SServer_test_ : is for testing the connection between client and server for the centralized scheme

_RS_Dist_Rx_ : This is the receiver code for the distributed scheme

_RS_Dist_Tx_ : This is the transmitter code for the distributed scheme

_Jammer_ : This is the code for the jammer nodes, that serve for external interference
